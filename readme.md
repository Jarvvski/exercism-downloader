# Exercism auto downloader

This is for [exercism.io](https://exercism.io)

I had the need to download a bunch of the problems for a flight I was taking, so obviously I wouldn't have an internet connection.

Included are the lists for **c++**, **java** and **javascript**

However, I've included some javascript that you can run in the console of a track page such as https://exercism.io/my/tracks/java which will copy a pre-formated list of exercises to your clipboard to create a new list file.

## usage (asuming you're in the correct directory):

./downloader <list-file>
